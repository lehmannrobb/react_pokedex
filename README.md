# react_pokedex
A Pokedex app built with React (work in progress)
## Bugs
- Still loading out of order (replaced 'forEach' with 'for' loop and still does)
- After multiple btn clicks it clears output but continues where it left off (disable btn maybe? or cancel fetch then recall)
- ...

## Todos
- Add a search bar
- Add more region dexes and national dex
- Add individual pokemon info boxes (or pages) with abilities, stats, etc.
- Add styling for other types
- Style the banner, navbar, and the btns
- Add a 'load more' btn or some sort of pagination to keep more concise
