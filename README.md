# react_pokedex
A Pokedex app built with React (work in progress)
## Bugs
- Keeps loading out of order (tried async/await and sorting yet still loads out of order most of the time)
- After multiple btn clicks it clears output but continues where it left off (disable btn maybe? or cancel fetch then recall)
- ...

## Todos
- Add a search bar
- Add more region dexes and on national dex
- Add individual pokemon info boxes (or pages) with abilities, stats, etc.
- Add styling for other types
- Style the banner, navbar, and the btns
